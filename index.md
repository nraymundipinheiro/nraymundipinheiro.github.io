<h3 style="text-align:center">Hi, there! I'm Natalia</h3>

I graduated from the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign with honors in Engineering Physics in December of 2023.

I love solving physics problems with computational approaches. During my free
time, I enjoy picking up new projects to challenge myself; and, in the meantime,
I enhance my technical skills.
One of the most fulfilling projects I worked on was simulating a star system
(based on the solar system). I'm working on adding more features so that, later,
I can try simulating a binary star system. You can find more about
[this project here](https://github.com/nraymundipinheiro/star-system-simulator)
or you can check my [GitHub](https://github.com/nraymundipinheiro) account
to find other projects!

I will start my master's degree in Physics this August at Stony Brook.
I am hoping to extend my physics knowledge on certain topics, such as
statistical mechanics and some areas of astrophysics, and I would like to
work on research on compact objects. My plan is to prepare myself as best as I
can for a future position as a Ph.D. student.

In my free time, I love to play volleyball, dance, and play instruments. I also
like to spend time with friends, experimenting new, creative food from around
the world. I visit my family in Brazil during the breaks, and when I'm there,
I like traveling with them to Santa Catarina's beaches. I have a big dog
named Lobo (meaning wolf, in Portuguese), and he's the cuddliest little big boy
I know.

I'm open to talk about research in physics that can benefit from my knowledge in
computational physics. I'm also open to talk about jobs in physics laboratories,
R&D companies, and software engineering positions.
However, if you would like to talk about anything else&mdash;shoot me an email
too! I love making new friends around the world.
